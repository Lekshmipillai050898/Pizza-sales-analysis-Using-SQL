# Pizza-sales-analysis-Using-SQL

This project involves analyzing a pizza sales dataset using SQL. The analysis includes data cleaning, key business metric calculations,
and detailed sales insights. The goal is to help the business understand its revenue patterns, customer behavior, and best-selling products.

## Project Overview

In this project, SQL was used to clean and analyze sales data from a pizza restaurant. The key performance indicators (KPIs) were calculated, 
and trend-based insights were derived to help improve business decisions. This analysis can guide pricing, marketing strategies, inventory planning,
and performance tracking.

## Tools Used

1.SQL (Structured Query Language)

2.Excel (for data exploration and results viewing)

##Tasks Performed

1. Data Cleaning:

Total Order Value (AOV)- â‚¹ 38.31
Total Pizza Sold-	49,574 units
Total Orders-	21,350 orders
Average Order Quantity-	2.32 pizzas/order

SQL queries were written to calculate these metrics directly from the database using aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG().
